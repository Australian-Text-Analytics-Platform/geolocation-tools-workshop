    "Most tokenised terms in the sentence have O as their NER value (that is the letter O not the number 0). Some however have been categorised. For instance, Van and Diemen are both classified as being PERSON named entities, Tasman is an ORGANIZATION and Cape and Pillar are in the LOCATION category. These categories are specific to Stanza. There are two key levels of processing available - the normal level will only identify the categories LOCATION, ORGANIZATION and PERSON, but the high recall processing will also consider other specialised phrases like TIME and MONEY which are not really named entities. Stanza can also look for the categories used in the KBP competition like CITY, COUNTRY and NATIONALITY, but this fine-grained processing will be slower.\n"
