Sometimes though it is hard to work out whether an NE is a person, organisation or a location. For instance, spaCy has said _Van Diemen's_ and _Tasman_ are both ORG NE. While both could be the names of people (Dutch explorer Abel Tasman and Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Anthony van Diemen) but they are actually part of the larger NEs _Van Diemen's Land_ (the former name for the state of Tasmania) and _Tasman's Head_ (a headland in Tasmania).

    "Rather than keeping the entire address, the name of the matching location has been shortened to the leftmost phrase in the address. Likewise, the _PartOf_ value is generally extracted from the rightmost phrase in the address. However, for FtToHNL, you need to discriminate between locations in different states of Australia. For that reason, the notebook code will change to the second rightmost phrase in the address for Australian locations. This is normally the name of the state, but sometimes is an Australian postcode so the notebook needs to work out which state corresponds to which postcode and use that instead. For your research, you may need to similarly tailor how to handle the output from any gazetteer you use to your needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also notice that the OSM output has a _class_ and a _type_ value that are both similar to the _Category_ value from our reference file and the NER, yet also have distinctly different values. This is a common issue. Just like there are no universal set of categories used by NER systems, there is no universal set for gazetteers. In fact, even the OSM doesn't have a clearly defined set of values. Some values are very general, e.g., _locality_ or _administrative_, but others are very specific, e.g., _cafe_ or  _place_of_worship_. However, it is important contextual information to use when evaluating what locations may be relevant. _type_ is more specific (or fine-grained) than _class_ so it is used as the _Category_ for any OSM matching locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OSM also provides an _importance_ value to each query response. This is not useful information because it relates to the importance of the location, based on [how often a related page is linked to in Wikipedia](https://github.com/osm-search/wikipedia-wikidata), rather than the quality of the search match. The ranking order of the OSM locations in a query reponse [can be customised](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/customize/Ranking/), but this notebook just uses the defaults settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that the Nominatim OSM queries don't try to find exact matches for the placenames. Nominatim isn't very clear about how exactly they match the placenames, but partial matches seem to be made. For instance, _Mount Royal_ matches with locations called _Mount Royal_ as well as _Mont-Royal_. Likewise, _South Cape_ matches with _Cape_. These indicate that when searching for multi-word expressions, the Nominatim API will match both the entire expression as well as single words within the expression. There is no clear instructions on how you can narrow down the search to only look for exact matches. "
