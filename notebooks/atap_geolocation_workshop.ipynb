Most of FtToHNL is set in Australia but references are made to parts of Great Britain, so that is what you should focus on. A list of places-of-interest can be made for Australia and one for Great Britain. While these are very finite sets of places, you need to make sure you match the spelling in the gazetteers you have used."
