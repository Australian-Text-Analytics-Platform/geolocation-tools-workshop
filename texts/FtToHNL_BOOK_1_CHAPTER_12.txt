CHAPTER XII.

A NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH.



Extracted from the Hobart Town Courier of the 12th November, 1827:--

"The examination of the prisoners who were concerned in the attempt
upon the Malabar was concluded on Tuesday last.  The four ringleaders,
Dawes Gabbett, Vetch, and Sanders, were condemned to death;
but we understand that, by the clemency of his Excellency the Governor,
their sentence has been commuted to six years at the penal settlement
of Macquarie Harbour."
