## Using notebooks on cloud services  <a class="anchor" id="section-binder"></a>

__[TO DO] Describe *briefly* how to run the notebooks, or point to the slides__ 

The above links to the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service enable you to load the notebook in a online cloud environment, rather than having to install the software on your own computer (it might take a little while to load). This is a free service, but note that cloud sessions will close if you stop using the notebooks, and no data will be saved. Make sure you download any changed notebooks or harvested data that you want to save.

## Australian Text Analytics Platform <a class="anchor" id="section-atap"></a>

The [Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)](https://www.atap.edu.au) is an open source environment that provides researchers with tools and training for analysing, processing, and exploring text. This includes using a [range of resources](https://www.atap.edu.au/resources), including the [Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL)](https://slcladal.github.io/) which aims to help develop computational and digital skills by providing information and practical, hands-on tutorials on data and text analytics as well as on statistical methods relevant for language research. 

The ATAP projects [received investment](https://doi.org/10.47486/PL074) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).
